DAE Tags ->

	DAE.StaticByteSize -> 
		Indicates the number of bytes to be stored with the row.  Refer to the DAE Developers Guide
		for a complete discussion of the DAE value overflow architecture.  The Value of this tag must 
		be an integer.

	Meta Data tags controlling SQL translation and reconciliation ->
	
		Storage.Name -> 
			Indicates that the schema object on which it appears is identified by the Value of the tag when translated to the device.
			
		Storage.Length -> 
			Indicates the storage length for domains which are translated to character types in SQL such as varchar or nvarchar.
		
		Storage.Precision -> 
			Indicates the storage precision for domains which are translated to exact numeric types in SQL such as decimal or numeric.
			
		Storage.Scale -> 
			Indicates the storage scale for domains which are translated to exact numeric types in SQL such as decimal or numeric.

		Storage.Deferred -> 
			Indicates that the values for the column or domain on which it appears should be read entirely as overflow.  See the

	Basic SQL to D4 Data Type Mapping ->
		These data type mappings are only a general suggestion.  Each device may provide different mappings based on the
		capabilities of the underlying SQL-based DBMS.
