AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing notes, documentation,
articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages, blogs and UNIX man
pages.  AsciiDoc files can be translated to many formats including
HTML, PDF, EPUB, man page.  AsciiDoc is highly configurable: both the
AsciiDoc source file syntax and the backend output markups (which can
be almost any type of SGML/XML markup) can be customized and extended
by the user.

This is an overly large document, it probably needs to be refactored
into a Tutorial, Quick Reference and Formal Reference.

If you're new to AsciiDoc read this section and the <<X6,Getting
Started>> section and take a look at the example AsciiDoc (`*.txt`)
source files in the distribution `doc` directory.

This directory contains the source code distribution of Dataphor.

Dataphor is an open source application development platform designed to
streamline the process of designing, developing, and maintaining software
applications.  Dataphor is not just another set of application framework
components, or yet another take on building applications using today's
common patterns, such as MVC/MVP; Dataphor re-approaches the problem from a
fresh perspective, building from first principles.

See https://github.com/DBCG/Dataphor for the newest source code.  For more
information look at our web site located at http://dataphor.org.

=== INSTALLATION

To get started with running Dataphor as a developer, using its Dataphoria
IDE, open Dataphor/Dataphor.sln in MS Visual Studio 2013 or another
suitable environment, and select Dataphoria as the startup project to run.

The file Documentation/Dataphor.chm has the main documentation as it
exists, though this is somewhat out of date.

While Dataphor is mainly used in production as a federation of SQL DBMSs
such as MS SQL Server, Oracle, and Postgres, it also has its own built-in
database engine called 'MemoryDevice' or 'SimpleDevice' respectively, and
so you can start off using Dataphor without needing to first install any
external dependencies.

=== TROUBLESHOOTING

If Dataphoria fails after startup with an error message citing a missing
DLL or such, try using "Rebuild Solution" rather than "Build Solution" in
MS Visual Studio as that is more reliable for making sure all the parts of
Dataphor have been compiled and are not missing.

Further documentation is pending.
