[[FTRTagsDescriptions-DAETags]]
== DAE Tags

This section lists the tags recognized by the Data Access Engine (DAE).
The Data Access Engine is the query processor component of the Dataphor
Server. DAE tags generally pertain to the runtime behavior of the
Dataphor Server.

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-DAETags-Enforced]]
=== Enforced

Determines whether the constraint on which it appears is enforced by the
Dataphor Server. Setting the DAE.Enforced tag to false disables
constraint validation in the Dataphor Server for the given constraint.
The default determination for this setting is made by the compiler.

*Syntax*

....
DAE.Enforced = "true | false"
....

*Applicable On*

* Scalar Type Constraints
* Column Constraints
* Keys
* Row Constraints
* Transition Constraints
* Reference Constraints
* Catalog Constraints

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-DAETags-IsClustered]]
=== IsClustered

Determines whether the key or order on which it appears is the clustered
key for the table. This designation has several implications within the
Dataphor Server, as well as for storage translation.

Within the Dataphor Server, the clustering key is used to determine an
access path when an otherwise arbitrary selection would be made.

In translation, the designation indicates that the given key or order is
to be used as the clustered index, or physical ordering, for the table
variable.

By default, the compiler will select a clustering key based on physical
considerations.

*Syntax*

....
DAE.IsClustered = "true | false"
....

*Applicable On*

* Keys
* Orders

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-DAETags-IsComputed]]
=== IsComputed

Indicates whether a given column should recompute its value in response
to proposable calls from the CLI. Only valid when introduced in an
**add**, *redefine* or specify operator. By default, the value of the
IsComputed tag is true, meaning that on a Change proposable call, the
value of the column will be recomputed based on the expression in the
*add* or *redefine* operator. To disable this recomputation, set the
value of the IsComputed tag to false.

*Syntax*

....
DAE.IsComputed = "true | false"
....

*Applicable On*

* Columns

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-DAETags-IsDeferred]]
=== IsDeferred

Overrides the default determination for whether the constraint or event
handler on which it appears should be deferred to transaction commit
time. The default value for this setting is determined by the compiler
based on the specific circumstances for each object. Refer to the
documentation for each object type in the D4 Language Guide for more
information.

*Syntax*

....
DAE.IsDeferred = "true | false"
....

*Applicable On*

* Row Constraints
* Transition Constraints
* References

=== IsOrderDependent

Specifies whether or not the aggregate operator on which it appears is
an order-dependent aggregate operator. For more information on
order-dependent aggregate operators, refer to the Aggregate Operators
section of the Catalog Elements chapter of the D4 Language Guide.

*Syntax*

....
DAE.IsOrderDependent = "true | false"
....

*Applicable On*

* Aggregate Operators

=== IsOrderPreserving

Overrides the default determination for whether the operator on which it
appears is an order-preserving operator. For more information on
order-preserving operators, refer to the Operators section of the
Language Elements chapter of the D4 Language Guide.

*Syntax*

....
DAE.IsOrderPreserving = "true | false"
....

*Applicable On*

* Operators

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-DAETags-IsSparse]]
=== IsSparse

Determines whether the key on which it appears is a sparse key. If a key
is defined as sparse, then the uniqueness constraint is enforced only
for rows which have a value specified for all the columns of the key. By
contrast, a dense key enforces that only one row within a table variable
is allowed to contain no values for the columns of the key. The default
value for this setting is false.

*Syntax*

....
DAE.IsSparse = "true | false"
....

*Applicable On*

* Keys

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-DAETags-MessageorSimpleMessage]]
=== Message or SimpleMessage

Specifies a custom message to be used to display an error to the user
when a constraint is violated. The Message tag must be a valid D4
expression. The same parameters available for writing the constraint
expression are available within the message expression. Note that for
transition constraints, a different message can be supplied for each
transition by qualifying the message tag with the transition. For
example, the tag DAE.Insert.Message can be used to specify the violation
message for the insert transition of a given transition constraint.

*Syntax*

....
DAE.[<transition>.]Message = "<expression>"
DAE.[<transition>.]SimpleMessage = "<string>"

<transition> ::= Insert | Update | Delete
....

*Applicable On*

* Scalar Type Constraints
* Column Constraints
* Row Constraints
* Keys
* References
* Transition Constraints
* Catalog Constraints

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-DAETags-Representation]]
=== Representation

Specifies a representation to be used to access values of the type on
which it appears. Determines which representation should be used by
controls in the Frontend Clients.

*Syntax*

....
DAE.<native accessor name> = "<representation name>"

<native accessor name> ::=
    AsBoolean |
    AsByte |
    AsInt16 |
    AsInt32 |
    AsInt64 |
    AsDecimal |
    AsTimeSpan |
    AsDateTime |
    AsGuid |
    AsString |
    AsDisplayString |
    AsException |
    AsByteArray
....

*Applicable On*

* Scalar Types

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-DAETags-ShouldTranslate]]
== DAE.ShouldTranslate - Metadata TagDAE
TagsShouldTranslateShouldTranslate

Overrides the default determination for whether the object on which it
appears should be translated into an application transaction. The
default value for this setting is determined by the compiler based on
the specific circumstances for each object. Refer to the documentation
for each object type in the D4 Language Guide for more information.

*Syntax*

....
DAE.ShouldTranslate = "true | false"
....

*Applicable On*

* Operators
* Table Variables
* Event Handlers

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-StorageTags]]
== Storage Tags

This section lists the tags recognized by the Storage Integration
Architecture (SIA). These tags generally control how the Dataphor Server
maps schema objects into underlying storage systems.

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-StorageTags-Deferred]]
=== Deferred

Specifies whether or not reads should be deferred for the domain or
column on which it appears. This tag is used by the SQL devices to
indicate that the data type used in the target system supports deferred
read access. When this tag is used, columns that are deferred are not
retrieved with the initial query. Instead, the device creates a deferred
read stream that accesses the data of the column only when it is
actually requested through the CLI.

*Syntax*

....
Storage.Deferred = "true | false"
....

*Applicable On*

* Columns
* Scalar Type Maps
* Scalar Types

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-StorageTags-Enforced]]
=== Enforced

This tag has been deprecated. Use the DAE.Enforced tag to indicate
whether a constraint should be enforced. For backwards compatibility,
the Storage.Enforced tag will continue to function as described in this
documentation, but support for this tag will be dropped in a future
version. Note that the semantics for the DAE.Enforced tag are the
opposite of the Storage.Enforced tag, in other words setting
Storage.Enforced to true has the same effect as setting DAE.Enforced to
false. Because the tag is deprecated, the compiler will automatically
replace Storage.Enforced tags with the appropriate DAE.Enforced tag.

Determines whether the constraint on which it appears is enforced by the
device. If the device is responsible for enforcing a given constraint,
the Dataphor Server does not attempt to enforce it. In other words,
setting the Enforced tag to true effectively disables constraint
validation in the Dataphor Server for the given constraint. The default
determination for this setting is made by the compiler.

*Syntax*

....
Storage.Enforced = "true | false"
....

*Applicable On*

* Scalar Type Constraints
* Column Constraints
* Keys
* Row Constraints
* Transition Constraints
* Reference Constraints
* Catalog Constraints

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-StorageTags-IsClustered]]
=== IsClustered

This tag has been deprecated. Use the DAE.IsClustered tag instead. For
backwards compatibility, the Storage.IsClustered tag will continue to
function as described in this documentation, but support for this tag
will be dropped in a future version. Because the tag is deprecated, the
compiler will automatically replace Storage.IsClustered tags with
DAE.IsClustered tags.

Determines whether the key or order on which it appears is the clustered
key for the table. This designation has several implications within the
Dataphor Server, as well as for storage translation.

Within the Dataphor Server, the clustering key is used to determine an
access path when an otherwise arbitrary selection would be made.

In translation, the designation indicates that the given key or order is
to be used as the clustered index, or physical ordering, for the table
variable.

By default, the compiler will select a clustering key based on physical
considerations.

*Syntax*

....
Storage.IsClustered = "true | false"
....

*Applicable On*

* Keys
* Orders

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-StorageTags-IsSparse]]
=== IsSparse

WARNING: This tag has been deprecated. Use the DAE.IsSparse tag instead. The
semantics of the tag are the same. For backwards compatibility, the
Storage.IsSparse will continue to function as described in this
documentation, but support for this tag will be dropped in a future
version. Because the tag is deprecated, the compiler will automatically
replace Storage.IsSparse tags with DAE.IsSparse tags.

Determines whether the key on which it appears is a sparse key. If a key
is defined as sparse, then the uniqueness constraint is enforced only
for rows which have a value specified for all the columns of the key. By
contrast, a dense key enforces that only one row within a table variable
is allowed to contain no values for the columns of the key. The default
value for this setting is false.

*Syntax*

....
Storage.IsSparse = "true | false"
....

*Applicable On*

* Keys

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-StorageTags-Length]]
=== Length

Specifies the length of the domain definition to be used in the target
system (i.e. VARCHAR(40)). This tag is used by the string-like scalar
type maps introduced by the various SQL devices. Essentially, any type
map that makes use of a CHAR or VARCHAR type on the target system will
search for this tag to determine the length of the character data to be
used in the target system. The tag is searched for in the following
order:

1.  Column metadata
2.  Scalar type map metadata
3.  Scalar type metadata

*Syntax*

....
Storage.Length = "<integer>"
....

*Applicable On*

* Columns
* Scalar Type Maps
* Scalar Types

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-StorageTags-Name]]
=== Name

Specifies the name of the object in the target system. For schema
objects that were imported from existing schema in target systems, the
Name tag will be set to the name of the corresponding schema object in
the target system. For schema objects created within the Dataphor
Server, the Name tag can be used to specify the name of the
corresponding schema object created or referenced in the target system.

*Syntax*

....
Storage.Name = "<string>"
....

*Applicable On*

* Scalar Types
* Scalar Type Maps
* Table Variables
* Columns
* Keys
* Orders

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-StorageTags-Precision]]
=== Precision

Specifies the precision of the domain definition to be used in the
target system (i.e. DECIMAL(12)). This tag is used by the decimal-like
scalar type maps introduced by the various SQL devices. Essentially, any
type map that makes use of a NUMERIC or DECIMAL type on the target
system will search for this tag to determine the precision of the
decimal data to be used in the target system. The tag is searched for in
the following order:

1.  Column metadata
2.  Scalar type map metadata
3.  Scalar type metadata

*Syntax*

....
Storage.Precision = "<integer>"
....

*Applicable On*

* Columns
* Scalar Type Maps
* Scalar Types

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-StorageTags-Scale]]
=== Scale

Specifies the scale of the domain definition to be used in the target
system (i.e. DECIMAL(12, 2)). This tag is used by the decimal-like
scalar type maps introduced by the various SQL devices. Essentially, any
type map that makes use of a NUMERIC or DECIMAL type on the target
system will search for this tag to determine the scale of the decimal
data to be used in the target system. The tag is searched for in the
following order:

1.  Column metadata
2.  Scalar type map metadata
3.  Scalar type metadata

*Syntax*

....
Storage.Scale = "<integer>"
....

*Applicable On*

* Columns
* Scalar Type Maps
* Scalar Types

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-StorageTags-Schema]]
=== Schema

Specifies the schema name of the object in the target system. For schema
objects that were imported from existing schema in target systems, the
Schema tag will be set to the name of the schema for the corresponding
schema object in the target system. For schema objects created within
the Dataphor Server, the Schema tag can be used to specify the schema
name of the corresponding schema object created in the target system.
The value of the Schema tag will override the value of the Schema
attribute set on an SQL device. Note that some target systems to not
support the concept of database schemas, and will therefore ignore the
value of this tag.

*Syntax*

....
Storage.Schema = "<string>"
....

*Applicable On*

* Table Variables
* Keys
* Orders

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-StorageTags-Scope]]
=== Scope

Specifies the storage scope for the table variable. This tag only
applied to table variables stored in a memory device. The scope can be:

* Database
* Session
* Process

Regardless of the scope of the table variable, the definition of the
type and structure of the table variable is the same for the all scopes.
However, the contents of the table variable will vary based on the
scope. For database-scoped table variables (the default), the same
storage is provided for all sessions and processes. For session-scoped
table variables, a different storage space is provided for each session,
and similarly for process-scoped table variables, a different storage
space is provided for each process.

*Syntax*

....
Storage.Scope = "Database | Session | Process"
....

*Applicable On*

* Table Variables (only if stored in a Memory Device)

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-StorageTags-ShouldReconcile]]
=== ShouldReconcile

Determines whether or not the object on which it appears should be
reconciled with the target system. By default, the value of the
ShouldReconcile tag is true, meaning that the object should be
reconciled with the target system. A value of false indicates that no
reconciliation will be performed with the target system. This
designation is used in addition to the reconciliation mode and master of
each device.

*Syntax*

....
Storage.ShouldReconcile = "true | false"
....

*Applicable On*

* Table Variables
* Columns
* Keys
* Orders

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-FrontendTags]]
== Frontend Tags

This section lists the tags recognized by the Frontend.
Note that these tags may appear in various contexts throughout the metadata, and that the Frontend Server will search for these tags in specific ways, based on the type of user interface being derived.
For more information on how the Frontend uses these tags, refer to link:DDGPresentationLayer.html[Presentation Layer].
For more specific information on the use of tags to guide derivation of the user interface see link:DDGTheAutomationofForms-GuidingDerivation.html[Guiding Derivation].

Frontend tags can be specific or general. For example:

....
ID : Integer tags { Frontend.Visible = "false" }
....

indicates that the ID is not to appear on any user interface (form)
regardless of what mode the user interface is in.

....
ID : Integer tags { Frontend.Browse.Visible = "false" }
....

indicates ID will not be visible when the user-inteface (form) is in the
browse mode. When the user interface is in any other mode, ID will be
visible.

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-FrontendTags-EliminateGroup]]
=== EliminateGroup

Determines whether the group on which it appears should be eliminated by
the structuring process.

By default, the structuring process will eliminate groups containing
only a single element. This is done to avoid unnecessary groupings of
controls on forms. However, in cases where a single-element group is
desired, this tag can be used to keep the group from being eliminated.

*Syntax*

....

....

*Applicable On*

* Tables (in a Group extraction context)
* References (in a Group extraction context)

Indicates that the object on which it appears should be presented with a
read-only user interface. The default value for this tag depends on
context, and is usually based on the inferred read-only characteristics
for each column.

*Syntax*

....
Frontend.ReadOnly = "true | false"
....

*Applicable On*

* Scalar Types footnote:[Indirectly. This tag is never looked for by the
Frontend Server on a scalar type specifically. Specifying the tag on a
scalar type "defaults" the tag for all columns of that type.]
* Columns
* Tables
* Views

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-FrontendTags-Secure]]
=== Secure

Determines how the object on which it appears should behave in derived
user interfaces if it is not accessible by the current user because of
security. The default value for this tag is hidden, indicating that no
user interface element will be visible for the object.

*Syntax*

....
Frontend.Secure = "visible | disabled | hidden"
....

*Applicable On*

* Tables
* Views
* References

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-FrontendTags-ShouldEnlist]]
=== ShouldEnlist

Indicates whether or not to enlist in an existing application
transaction within the derived user interface for the table variable on
which it appears. The default value for this tag is default, indicating
that the determination should be made based on the cardinality of the
result set for the derived user interface being displayed.

[[FTRTagsDescriptions-FrontendTags-TreatAsLookup]]
=== TreatAsLookup

This tag can be used on a parent reference to indicate whether or not
the query elaboration process should treat the reference as a parent or
lookup reference. If the reference is treated as a parent reference, the
target table will be included in the result set using an inner join. If
the reference is treated as a lookup reference (the default), the target
table will be included in the result set using a left outer join, and
the user interface will be constructed as though the reference were a
lookup reference (i.e. using lookup controls to browse for the item to
be selected, rather than entering the information directly on the
derived form).

*Syntax*

....
Frontend.TreatAsLookup = "true | false"
....

*Applicable On*

* References (parent references only)
