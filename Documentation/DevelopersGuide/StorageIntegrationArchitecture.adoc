[[DDGStorageIntegrationArchitecture]]
== Summary

Information in todays enterprises is stored in an ever-increasing number
of systems, from file-based data repositories, to SQL-based DBMSs, and
everything in between. The Dataphor Server provides a single
point-of-access for all these data sources through an abstraction called
the Storage Integration Architecture (SIA).

This architecture is based on the idea that fundamentally, all data may
be represented within a single unified model, namely the relational
model, and that access to any data source can be achieved by providing
an open-ended architecture that can communicate with any given data
source in whatever manner is appropriate.

The central abstraction of this architecture is called a __device__, and
represents a single instance of a data source. That data source may be
as simple as a formatted text file, or as complex as a traditional
SQL-based DBMS.

The SIA uses the concept of a device to define all the interfaces that
are required in order to enable not only access to the data, but to
allow offloading of query processing tasks to target systems whenever
possible. To enable this abstraction, the device architecture is layered
in much the same way that the Call-Level Interface is, dividing the
functionality into server, session, plan, and cursor layers.

The server level of the architecture is concerned with describing the
overall functionality of the device. This layer of the architecture
supplies the level at which device-wide settings and behavior are
implemented. Device sessions are obtained from this interface, with each
process in the Dataphor Server obtaining a separate session for
communicating with each device involved in a given transaction.

The session level of the architecture models the connectivity and
authentication capabilities of the target system, as well as the
transaction management facilities. Each session participates in the same
distributed transaction coordinated by the process running in the
Dataphor Server. The session also provides the mechanism for executing
commands and opening cursors against the target systems.

The plan level of the architecture models statement execution against
the target system. Each statement, or chunk of a statement, that can be
supported by the target system is represented by a single plan within
the Dataphor Server. The plan also provides facilities for opening a
cursor against the result set of the statement, where appropriate.

The cursor level of the architecture models retrieval of a result set
from the target system. This level of the architecture implements the
same interfaces required by cursors internally in the Dataphor Server.
This allows devices to participate directly in the pipelined execution
engine of the Dataphor Server. Moreover, device processing can be
spawned at any point in the execution tree, allowing the Dataphor Server
to offload as much processing as possible, while still guaranteeing that
any expression will ultimately be evaluated correctly, regardless of
where the data is physically located.

[[DDGStorageIntegrationArchitecture-ObjectMaps]]
== Object Maps

To enable the complete mapping of constructs and expressions in the
logical model, the SIA provides four basic types of maps:

* Scalar Type Maps
* Operator Maps
* Table Maps
* User Maps

Scalar type maps provide value translation services to and from the
target system. The scalar type map is responsible for translating values
from the native representation of a value within the Dataphor Server to
the device representation of the value within the target system, and
vice versa. Scalar type maps will be discussed in detail in
link:DDGScalarTypeMapping.html[Scalar Type Mapping]

Operator maps provide the translation services for operator invocations
from D4 to the corresponding invocation within the target system. These
mappings can be as simple as the mapping for basic arithmetic operators,
or as complex as the *join* operator. In either case, the map is
responsible not only for the translation of the invocation, but for
deciding whether or not the invocation is supported by the target
system. Operator maps will be discussed in detail in
link:DDGOperatorMapping.html[Operator Mapping]

Table maps provide the persistence mechanism of the Dataphor Server.
Each base table variable in the Dataphor Server is mapped to some
structure in the target system. Note that the structure may be a file, a
registry key, or an SQL-based table or view definition.

Typically, table mapping is done automatically using the default device
for the current library. For example, in the Shipping application, the
default device name in the Sample.Shipping library definition is set to
Shipping. After the Shipping device is created, any global base table
variable created in the Sample.Shipping library will be mapped into this
device.

User maps allow users created in the Dataphor Server to use a different
set of credentials to connect to the target system. These maps can be
configured on a per-user basis, allowing multiple users to use the same
set of credentials to connect to a given system. If no user mapping is
provided, the information configured on the device will be used. If no
configuration is supplied on the device, the Dataphor Server user
information will be used.

When a new connection to a device must be established for the current
process, the following sequence of steps is taken to determine which
device user should be used:

1.  If a device user mapping is set up for the current user explicitly,
that device user is used.
2.  If user configuration is provided on the device itself, that
information is used.
3.  Otherwise, the credentials for the current user are used.

If the above process selects a device user, and the selected device user
has explicitly specified connection parameters, these are used as
overrides for any connection parameters specified by the device and
connection string builder. For more information on how connection
strings are built, refer to the section on
link:DDGP2BasicConnectivity.html[Basic Connectivity].

[[DDGP2ProcessorIntegration]]
== Processor Integration

When an operator invocation in D4 is processed by some device, it is the
responsibility of that device to provide the results of the operation in
terms the Dataphor Server can understand. Conversely, when modification
to the data contained in a particular device is required, it is the
responsibility of the device to translate the request for modification
from the Dataphor Server into a form that can be consumed by the data
store being modeled. The Storage Integration Architecture provides the
framework for the solution to this problem.

Processor integration occurs whenever the Dataphor Server requires data
from some device, or whenever the data stored in some device needs to be
updated to reflect the changes made by some statement in the Dataphor
Server. The query chunking process determines where both of these
integration points occur.

This section first describes the retrieval integration, then the
modification integration, and concludes with a description of how these
integration points are determined by the compiler.

[[DDGP2DataRetrieval]]
=== Data Retrieval

The execution of a prepared device plan provides an alternative
execution path for the query processor to follow. The execution path can
be thought of as leaving the query processor at the device execute, and
re-entering when the device processing has completed. The results of the
processing are returned using native representations, just like any
other execution in the query processor. This allows device execution to
completely replace query processing at any point in the expression,
meaning that devices are not only capable of delivering data in the form
of tables, but also scalar values, row values, etc.,.

When non-table values are returned, device processing has generally
completed, and the value returned is autonomous in the sense that the
device session could be closed, without affecting the availability of
the value. For table values, this is generally not the case. Just as in
the Dataphor Server, device supported table values are materialized on
demand using cursors. For this reason, a typical device will provide a
cursor implementation to fulfill the interface requirements of a cursor
in the Dataphor Server.

[[DDGP2DataModification]]
=== Data Modification

In general, data modification can be supported by a given device at a
different level than retrieval. This allows the query updatability
capabilities of the Dataphor Server to be mapped onto devices which may
not support the same functionality, without compromising the retrieval
characteristics of the device.

There are three mechanisms by which a device may perform data
modifications:

* Modification Statements
+
Devices may be capable of executing complete insert, update, and delete
statements.
* Cursor Updates
+
Devices may provide updatability through cursors.
* Row Level Updates
+
Devices may provide updatability through row level commands.

The level at which data modifications are performed is determined by the
device implementation.

[[DDGP2QueryChunking3]]
=== Query Chunking

Query chunking is the process of determining exactly where a processor
integration point will occur during the processing of a specific query.

Basically, the process involves ensuring that a given branch of the
executable tree can be entirely handled by a given device, and then
requesting that the device prepare this portion of the expression. At
this point, the device will either provide a prepared plan ready for
execution in the device, or indicate that the requested operation cannot
be performed by the device.

The query chunking algorithm begins at the leaf nodes of the execution
tree. A leaf node is either a base table variable retrieval, or some
other node such as a literal value. For the base table variable
retrieval, the node is assigned to be processed on the device
responsible for storage of the base table variable. The device in
question is required to support this operation. For other types of leaf
nodes, no device is assigned, indicating the node is __device
associative__.

A device associative node is one for which the device can only be
determined in the context of some other operation. For example,
supporting an arbitrary scalar operation depends on which device, if
any, is requested to support the operation. At the level of the
operation itself, no device association is made, and only when the
operation is requested within the context of some other operation that
is associated with a given device can the device determination be made.

For example, given the following D4 statement:

....
select Invoice where ID = 5;
....

The ShowPlan system operator can be used to display the execution plan
chosen by the Dataphor Server:

....
select ShowPlan('select Invoice where ID = 5');
....

....
8438: RestrictNode
    Type:
        table
        {
            ID : InvoiceID,
            Location_ID : LocationID,
            User_ID : UserID,
            Date : Date,
            Status_ID : InvoiceStatusID
        }
        key { }
    Device: Shipping
    8483: BaseTableVarNode
        Type:
            table
            {
                ID : InvoiceID,
                Location_ID : LocationID,
                User_ID : UserID,
                Date : Date,
                Status_ID : InvoiceStatusID
            }
            key { ID }
        Device: Shipping
    8424: IntegerEqualNode
        Type: Boolean
        No device
        8423: ScalarReadAccessorNode
            Type: Integer
            No device
            8421: StackColumnReferenceNode
                Type: InvoiceID
                No device
                Column Name: ID Stack Index: 0
        8419: ValueNode
            Type: Integer
            No device
....

The ValueNode representing the literal integer value 5 is a device
associative node, because no device determination can be made by looking
at the node in isolation. Only when the entire equality expression ID =
5 is considered in the context of the *where* operator can the device
determination be made.

As the chunking process progresses, the devices are asked whether they
support the operations involved at a higher and higher level until
either the devices no longer support the operations involved, or the
operation spans multiple devices. In either of these cases, processing
is handled by the Dataphor Server.

In order to determine whether or not a given branch of the execution
tree is supported, the device is asked to prepare a device plan
corresponding to the root node of the branch. This prepare step invokes
the device compiler for translating the D4 instructions into equivalent
instructions in the device. If the device compilation step is
successful, the result is a prepared device plan ready for execution.
Otherwise, the chunking algorithm stops, and the query processor is
assigned to take over execution.

This algorithm naturally produces an expression tree which is optimized
to offload as much processing as possible to the devices involved. If
only a single device is involved and all the operations are supported by
that device, the entire tree is processed externally. Only when multiple
devices are involved, or some operation is requested which a device
cannot perform, does the Dataphor Server perform processing.

[[DDGDisplayingSQLTranslationOutput]]
==== Displaying SQL Translation Output

The D4ToSQL operator registered by the SQLDevice library can be used to
obtain the SQL for a statement that is completely supported by a given
device:

....
select D4ToSQL('select Invoice where ID = 5');
....

....
select
        "T1"."ID" as "ID",
        "T1"."Location_ID" as "Location_ID",
        "T1"."User_ID" as "User_ID",
        "T1"."Date" as "Date",
        "T1"."Status_ID" as "Status_ID"
    from "Sample__Shipping__Invoice" as "T1" (fastfirstrow)
    where ("T1"."ID" = @P1);
....

[[DDGSupportWarnings]]
==== Support Warnings

In order to help ensure that queries are being offloaded whenever
possible, the Dataphor Server will issue _unsupported_ warnings whenever
the chunking process results in an execution plan that only involves a
single device, but is not entirely supported on that device.

For example, consider the following operator definition and D4 query:

....
create operator UnsupportedOperator(const AID : Integer) : Integer
begin
    result := AID;
end;

select Invoice add { UnsupportedOperator(ID) TempID };
....

The invocation of UnsupportedOperator within the *add* clause causes the
compiler to issue a warning stating that the query was not supported
because the device does not contain an operator map for
UnsupportedOperator.

To disable this warning, use the IgnoreUnsupported modifier:

....
select Invoice
    add { UnsupportedOperator(ID) TempID }
        with { IgnoreUnsupported = "true" };
....

[[DDGStorageIntegrationArchitecture-Reconciliation]]
== Reconciliation

Each system represented by a device has its own schema to describe the
structures and data available within that system. The structure and
contents of this schema will vary considerably with each system. For
example, for a simple file-based device, the schema may consist of a
file list and structural descriptors within the files themselves.

Regardless of how the system structure is exposed, the device is
responsible for transforming that structural information into terms that
the Dataphor Server can understand. The device is also responsible for
translating structural changes in the schema of the Dataphor Server to
the target system.

This synchronization of catalog between the Dataphor Server and the
target systems involved is called __schema reconciliation__. Through
this process, catalog information can be imported from, exported to, or
reconciled with the catalog of each individual device.

Reconciliation is the process of synchronization of structure between
the Dataphor catalog and the device catalogs. The process can be
automatic, or user-initiated. Each device has two settings which
determine how and when reconciliation occurs, _reconciliation mode_ and
__reconciliation master__.

These settings can be specified as part of the device definition in the
*create device* statement, or they can be set using the *alter device*
statement. In addition, the reconciliation settings can be changed or
viewed by right-clicking on a device in the Dataphor Explorer in
Dataphoria.

The reconciliation mode can be either none, or any combination of
startup, command, and automatic.

The reconciliation modes have the following meaning.

* Startup indicates that the device should be reconciled when the
Dataphor Server starts, or when the device is initially created.
* Command indicates that Data Definition Language (DDL) commands
(create, alter, and drop statements) executed against the Dataphor
Server should be passed through to the device as well
* Automatic indicates that tables should be verified and updated
appropriately as they are encountered in Data Manipulation Language
(DML) statements (select, insert, update, and delete statements)
executed against the Dataphor Server.

In addition to these reconciliation modes, the reconciliation process
can be user-initiated with a call to the Reconcile operator. This
operator takes a single System.Name argument that is the name of the
device to be reconciled. The following example illustrates the use of
this operator:

....
Reconcile(Name("MyDevice"));
....

The reconciliation master can be server, device, or both. Server
indicates that the Dataphor Server is designated as the master copy of
the catalog. Device indicates that the device is considered the master
catalog, and both indicates that the catalogs should be reconciled from
both directions.

Reconciliation for a device proceeds as follows:

1.  If the reconciliation master setting is server or both, each table
in the DAE catalog is reconciled against the device. If a table does not
exist in the device, it is created; otherwise, it is updated to match
the table definition in the Dataphor Server.
2.  If the reconciliation master setting is device or both, each table
in the device catalog is reconciled against the Dataphor Server. If the
table does not exist in the Dataphor Server, it is created; otherwise,
it is updated to match the table definition in the device.

Beyond this basic process, each device may provide specific
reconciliation functionality.

Catalog reconciliation for a table proceeds as follows:

1.  If the Dataphor Server table is master, every column in the
definition of the table within the Dataphor Server must appear in the
definition of the table on the target system.
2.  If the device table is master, every column in the definition of the
table on the target system must appear in the definition of the table in
the Dataphor Server.

Tables imported into the Dataphor Server by this process will be named
using the name of the table in the target system, namespace qualified
with the name of the device. For example, if a device called Pubs is
reconciled against the pubs sample database that ships with Microsoft
SQL Server, the Dataphor Server will include a table called
Pubs.authors.

Data types for the columns of imported tables will be matched as closely
as possible to the system-provided types of the Dataphor Server. If a
data type cannot be reconciled, an appropriate error will be given.

[[DDGStorageIntegrationArchitecture-Reconciliation-StorageTags]]
=== Storage Tags

The following table lists the metadata tags that can be used to control
reconciliation and value translation in the SQL devices:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Tag Name |Meaning
|Storage.Name |Indicates that the object on which it appears should be
identified by the value of the tag when referenced within the device.

|Storage.Schema |Indicates that the object on which it appears should be
qualified by the value of the tag when referenced within the device.

|Storage.Length |Indicates the storage length for translated domains.
This tag is only used for the string types (System.String and like
types) to indicate the length of the VARCHAR data type to be used.

|Storage.Precision |Indicates the storage precision for exact numeric
data in translated domains. This tag is only used for the System.Decimal
type to indicate the precision of the DECIMAL data type to be used.

|Storage.Scale |Indicates the storage scale for exact numeric data in
translated domains. This tag is only used for the System.Decimal type to
indicate the scale of the DECIMAL data type to be used.

|Storage.Deferred |Indicates that the values for the column or domain on
which it appears should be read entirely as overflow. If the value of
this tag is true, the system will not retrieve values from this column
when the table is selected, rather, the device will defer reading of the
value for this column until it is actually read by the client
application. At that point, a separate stream is used to read data for
the column.

|Storage.Enforced a|
Indicates that the constraint on which it appears is enforced by some
target system, and need not be enforced by the Dataphor Server. Setting
this tag to true for a given constraint effectively disables enforcement
of the constraint within the Dataphor Server.

Note: This tag has been replaced by DAE.Enforce, with opposite semantics
(i.e. a Storage.Enforced tag of true is equivalent to a DAE.Enforced tag
of false.

|Storage.IsClustered a|
Indicates that the index used to support the key or order on which it
appears should be built as the clustered index, or physical ordering,
for the table variable. The actual implementation of clustered indexes
varies depending on the target system.

Note: This tag has been replaced by DAE.IsClustered.

|Storage.IsSparse a|
Indicates that the key on which it appears is a sparse key. Sparse keys
enforce uniqueness only among the rows which have values specified for
all columns of the key. Dense keys allow only one row to have no values
for the columns of the key. Note that sparse keys cannot be used as an
addressability mechanism.

Note: This tag has been replaced by DAE.IsSparse

|Storage.ShouldReconcile |Indicates whether or not the column, table,
key, or order on which it appears should be reconciled with the target
system.
|=======================================================================

[[DDGStorageIntegrationArchitecture-Reconciliation-ReconciliationintheSQLDevices]]
=== Reconciliation in the SQL Devices

Each SQL device is responsible for describing the contents of its system
catalog to the Dataphor Server so that the reconciliation process can
take place.

The SQL devices use three different statements to describe the system
catalog: the tables expression, the indexes expression, and the foreign
keys expression. Each of these expressions returns a result set that
lists the structural content of the system catalog. For a complete
description of each of these expressions, refer to the SQLDevice library
reference.

The AvailableTables and AvailableReferences operators can be used to
retrieve the set of tables or references currently available from a
given SQL device. For example, the following program listing shows the
output from the Shipping device:

....
Name                                                   StorageName
------------------------------------------------------ --------------------------------------
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__BidItem              Sample__Shipping__BidItem
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__Contact              Sample__Shipping__Contact
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__ContactAddress       Sample__Shipping__ContactAddress
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__ContactAddressDuring Sample__Shipping__ContactAddressDuring
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__ContactNameDuring    Sample__Shipping__ContactNameDuring
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__ContactNotes         Sample__Shipping__ContactNotes
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__ContactPhone         Sample__Shipping__ContactPhone
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__ContactPhoneDuring   Sample__Shipping__ContactPhoneDuring
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__Customer             Sample__Shipping__Customer
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__CustomerPicture      Sample__Shipping__CustomerPicture
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__Generators           Sample__Shipping__Generators
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__Invoice              Sample__Shipping__Invoice
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__InvoiceItem          Sample__Shipping__InvoiceItem
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__InvoiceItemNumbers   Sample__Shipping__InvoiceItemNumbers
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__InvoiceStatus        Sample__Shipping__InvoiceStatus
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__ItemType             Sample__Shipping__ItemType
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__Location             Sample__Shipping__Location
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__LocationItem         Sample__Shipping__LocationItem
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__PhoneType            Sample__Shipping__PhoneType
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__PurchaseOrder        Sample__Shipping__PurchaseOrder
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__SaleOrder            Sample__Shipping__SaleOrder
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__State                Sample__Shipping__State
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__Vendor               Sample__Shipping__Vendor
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__VendorItemType       Sample__Shipping__VendorItemType
Sample.Shipping.Sample__Shipping__ZipCode              Sample__Shipping__ZipCode
....

In addition to these result sets, the Reconcile operator itself, if used
in a select statement, will return a list of the errors that occurred
during the reconciliation process, if any.
