== Summary

In order to allow values of types defined in the logical model, the SIA
incorporates the concept of a _scalar type map_ that provides value
translation to and from the native representation of a scalar value
within the Dataphor Server, and the device representation of that value
in a given target system.

Each device has a set of type maps that indicate which D4 types are
supported by the device. For the SQL-based devices that ship with the
Dataphor product, the system-defined types such as System.Integer and
System.String are already mapped as part of the creation of the device.

In addition, the type mapping for user-defined types with a
system-provided native representation based on a mapped type is
automatically provided as necessary. As such, for most applications,
type mapping can be largely ignored. However, in some cases,
user-defined types will have host-implemented native representations,
requiring a host-implemented type map as well. This chapter discusses
how scalar type maps work, and what is involved in their creation and
usage.

It should be noted that there are some gray areas with respect to type
mapping due to the extremely diverse nature of representation of values
within different systems. A scalar type map is really a mathematical
function that relates the values in one domain to the values in another.
In a perfect world, the domains on both sides would have the same number
of values, and there would be a unique one-to-one correlation between
the domains.

In reality, the domains often have differing sets of values, and the
task of the scalar type map designer is to find the __best fit__. For
some types, such as a four-byte integer, the type map is uniquely
one-to-one. For other types, such as DateTime, the range of possible
values is so dramatically different from one system to the next that a
perfect fit becomes impossible. In these scenarios, the notion of
_acceptable range_ is used to attempt to guarantee functionality under a
given set of values. In the case of DateTime, this range is from January
1, 1900 00:00:00.0, to December 31, 2100 23:23:59.0, accurate to the
second.

Of course this range is well below the actual range of a DateTime value
within the Dataphor Server, but it represents a kind of least common
denominator among all target systems, and is based on the assumption
that all conceivable systems will at least be able to provide support
for this range of values. What acceptable range really defines is the
minimum level of support required for a given target system. Of course,
some systems provide much larger ranges for date time values, and the
notion of acceptable range does _not_ limit the set of values that can
be represented on a given target system. It merely specifies a target
level of support in order to guarantee functionality across devices.

Where appropriate, the acceptable ranges for various types are
documented with the type in the various library references.

[[DDGScalarTypeMapping-DeviceRepresentations]]
== Device Representations

The device representation for a scalar type is the representation of
values of that type within the target system. Scalar type maps provide
translation services to and from the native representation in the
Dataphor Server and this device representation.

Like the native representation, the device representation is expressed
in terms of a .NET CLR type. This representation is used when
communicating through the CLI of the target system.

For the SQL-based devices, type maps for the system-defined types have
already been provided. The following table lists the base SQL type maps
provided as registered classes in the SQLDevice library:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|======================================================
|D4 Data Type |Common SQL Data Type |Translation Class
|System.Boolean |INTEGER (0 or 1) |SQLDevice.SQLBoolean
|System.Byte |SMALLINT |SQLDevice.SQLByte
|System.Short |SMALLINT |SQLDevice.SQLShort
|System.Integer |INTEGER |SQLDevice.SQLInteger
|System.Long |BIGINT |SQLDevice.SQLLong
|System.Decimal |DECIMAL(P, S) |SQLDevice.SQLDecimal
|System.DateTime |DATETIME |SQLDevice.SQLDateTime
|System.Date |DATE |SQLDevice.SQLDate
|System.Time |TIME |SQLDevice.SQLTime
|System.TimeSpan |BIGINT |SQLDevice.SQLTimeSpan
|System.Money |DECIMAL(28, 8) |SQLDevice.SQLMoney
|System.Guid |CHAR(24) |SQLDevice.SQLGuid
|System.String |VARCHAR(L) |SQLDevice.SQLString
|SQLDevice.SQLText |CLOB |SQLDevice.SQLText
|System.Binary |BLOB |SQLDevice.SQLBinary
|System.Graphic |BLOB |SQLDevice.SQLGraphic
|======================================================

[[DDGScalarTypeMapping-SimpleTypeMaps]]
== Simple Type Maps

For simple scalar types, the Dataphor Server can usually provide an
appropriate type mapping automatically. When a table variable containing
a column of an unmapped scalar type, the Dataphor Server will search for
the type map of the native representation of the type. If one is found,
the translation handler for that type is used to construct the type
mapping for the new type.

For example, consider the following create table statement:

....
create table Invoice
{
    ID : InvoiceID { default InvoiceID(GetNextGenerator("Shipping.Invoice.ID")) }
        tags { Frontend.ReadOnly = "true" },
    Location_ID : LocationID,
    User_ID : UserID { default System.UserID() },
    Date : Date { default Date() },
    Status_ID : InvoiceStatusID { default InvoiceStatusID("NEW") },
    key { ID }
};
....

When the Dataphor Server attempts to map the table into the Shipping
device, if the InvoiceID type map did not exist, the Dataphor Server
would provide a map based on the System.Integer type mapping already
present, because InvoiceID is defined *like* System.Integer.

Similarly, in the following type map statement, the Dataphor Server
determines the translation handler to be used based on the definition of
the scalar type:

....
alter device Shipping { create type InvoiceID };
....

For the InvoiceID type, the type map is fairly straightforward because
the type specifier on the target system has no parameters. In contrast,
string-like types use the VARCHAR type on the target systems, and have
the potential to specify a length parameter as part of the type
specifier. This length parameter is taken from the value of the
Storage.Length tag.

The Storage.Length tag is taken from the metadata associated with the
scalar type map. If the tag is not found on the type map, it is taken
from the metadata associated with the scalar type itself. Note that when
the Dataphor Server constructs a type map automatically, it does not
infer metadata from the source type map. For example, consider the
following type definition:

....
create type Phone like String
{
    constraint LengthValid (Length(value) <= 20)
}
    tags { Frontend.Title = "Phone #", Frontend.Width = "15" }
    static tags { Storage.Length = "20" };
....

Even though the System.String type specifies a Storage.Length tag, the
value of that tag is overridden by the Phone type itself. When the
Dataphor Server constructs a scalar type map for the Phone type, it will
be based on the translation handler used for the System.String type, but
that translation handler will use the Storage.Length tag from the Phone
type definition.

In addition, the Storage.Length tag can be specified on the type map
directly. For example:

....
alter device Shipping { create type Phone tags { Storage.Length = "20" } };
....

The Storage.Length tag specified here will effectively override the
Storage.Length tag specified on the type definition.

To explicitly specify the translation handler, the registered class to
be used can be specified as part of the type map definition. For
example, consider the following statement:

....
alter device Shipping { create type Degree class "SQLDevice.SQLDecimal" };
....

[[DDGScalarTypeMapping-Host-ImplementedTypeMaps]]
== Host-Implemented Type Maps

In addition to the type maps provided by the SQL devices, developers can
build custom scalar type maps for use in mapping more complex types into
target system. The Coordinate type in the Shipping application utilizes
a custom scalar type map. The map is provided as a registered class in
the Shipping library. footnote:[The source code for this map can be
found in the Source subdirectory of the Shipping library directory in
the file Domains.cs.].

The following D4 statement uses the SQLCoordinate registered class to
create the scalar type map for the Coordinate type:

....
alter device Shipping { create type Coordinate class "Shipping.SQLCoordinate" };
....

For more information on building host-implemented scalar type maps,
