[[D4LGIntroduction]]
== Summary

D4 provides a powerful set of data manipulation capabilities, as well as
a rich type system for describing even the most complex data. D4 also
supports a full complement of flow control constructs, including
exception handling, to provide a complete development language with data
manipulation capabilities. Using D4, the impedance mismatch that
traditionally exists between the database access language and the host
programming language is eliminated, enabling a single data access and
development paradigm.

[[D4LGIntroduction-PurposeoftheD4Language]]
== Purpose of the D4 Language

The Dataphor Server uses a simple, yet powerful data access and
manipulation language called D4. All manipulation of the application
schema and its data are done using this language. There are three broad
categories of statements in D4: Structural, Manipulative, and
Imperative.

* *Structural statements* (also called Data Definition Language (DDL))
manipulate the definition of the data model. These are used to describe
the structure of the data to be stored. These include statements like
create, drop, and alter.
* *Manipulative statements* (also called Data Manipulation Language
(DML)) manipulate the actual data in the database. These are used to
insert, update and delete data in the database, as well as retrieve it
for presentation and analysis.
* *Imperative statements* provide the framework for execution in D4.
These statements include variable declaration and assignment, flow
control, and exception handling.

D4 is a relationally complete language based on the relational algebra.
The syntax of the language is designed to allow the developer to express
queries naturally and easily.

Production RulesGrammarTerminalsNon-TerminalsThis language guide uses a
variation of Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) to describe the syntax of
D4. The variations facilitate the expression of list structures which
are common in the language. EBNF is made up of three types of elements:
terminals, non-terminals, and symbols. These elements are used to create
__production rules__. The set of production rules describing the
language is called the __grammar__. Each non-terminal in the grammar
must have an associated production rule.

Non-terminals in EBNF are delimited by angle brackets (< and >). The
identifier inside the angle brackets is the name of the non-terminal.

Symbols are used to indicate how terminals and non-terminals are grouped
together. The following symbols are used in EBNF:

* Pipe (|)
+
The pipe is used to indicate an exclusive or. For example the sequence a
| b means that the result could be a or b but not both.
* Parentheses (( and ))
+
Parentheses are used to force a grouping within the sequence. For
example the sequence a (b | c) produces the strings ab or ac, while the
sequence (a b) | c produces the strings ab or c.
* Brackets ([ and ])
+
Brackets are used to indicate that a given sequence is optional. For
example a [ b ] means that the result could be a or ab.
* Braces (\{ and })
+
Braces are used to indicate that a given sequence may appear as many
times as desired, including none. For example a \{ b } means that the
result could be a, or ab, or abb, etc.,.
* Double Quotes (")
+
Double quotes are used to indicate that a character that would normally
be a symbol should be treated as a terminal. For example a "\{" b "}"
means that the result should be a \{ b }.

Every other character in EBNF is a terminal. Terminals should appear in
the result exactly as written in the production rules.

Production rules consist of a non-terminal followed by the symbol ::=
(which can be read: __is defined as__) and then a sequence of characters
consisting of terminals, non-terminals, and symbols. Non-terminals
appearing in the body of a production rule may be replaced with the body
of the production rule corresponding to the name of the non-terminal.
This process is repeated until there are no non-terminals in the string,
and a valid sentence of the language is formed.

For example, consider the following simple grammar:

....
<identifier> ::=
    ( _ | <letter> ) { _ | <digit> | <letter> }
....

The non-terminals <letter> and <digit> have the obvious interpretation.
This production rule indicates that an <identifier> is defined as an
underscore or a letter, followed by any number of characters that can be
an underscore, a digit, or a letter. The following strings are valid
words in the language described by this grammar:

....
_Identifier
_2222222
My_Identifier
Foo
....

While the following strings are not words in the language described by
this grammar:

....
12345
Ident#12
....

In addition to basic EBNF, the notation used in the guide has the
following extensions:

* Lists
+
The word _list_ appearing at the end of the name of a non-terminal
indicates the existence of an implicit production rule given by:
+
....
<XYZ list> ::= { <XYZ> }
....
* Comma separated lists
+
The word _commalist_ appearing at the end of the name of a non-terminal
indicates the existence of an implicit production rule given by:
+
....
<XYZ commalist> ::= [ <XYZ> {, <XYZ> } ]
....
* Semi-colon separated lists
+
The word _semicolonlist_ appearing at the end of the name of a
non-terminal indicates the existence of an implicit production rule
given by:
+
....
<XYZ semicolonlist> ::= [ <XYZ> {; <XYZ> } ]
....
* Non-empty lists
+
The word _ne_ appearing at the beginning of the name of a non-terminal
with the word __list__, __commalist__, or _semicolonlist_ appearing at
the end of the non-terminal indicates the existence of an implicit
production rule given by:
+
....
<ne XYZ list> ::= <XYZ> { <XYZ> }
<ne XYZ commalist> ::= <XYZ> {, <XYZ> }
<ne XYZ semicolonglist> ::= <XYZ> {; <XYZ> }
....

These extensions are the same as those used in reference [3].
