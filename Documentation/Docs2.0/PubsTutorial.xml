		  <para>This tutorial makes use of the pubs database supplied with the
				MSSQL server. The following is from the Microsoft web site:
				<blockquote>
					 <para>Pubs Sample Database</para>
					 <para> The pubs sample database is modeled after a book
						  publishing company and is used to demonstrate many of the options available for
						  a Microsoft® SQL Server™ database. The database and its tables are commonly
						  used in the examples presented in the documentation content.</para>
					 <para> If you have made changes to the pubs database, you can
						  reinstall it using files located in the Install directory of your SQL Server
						  installation. The installation process requires two steps:</para>
					 <orderedlist>
						  <listitem>
								<para>From the command prompt, use the osql utility to
									 run the Instpubs.sql script. This drops the existing pubs database, creates a
									 new one, and defines all the objects in the database.</para>
						  </listitem>
						  <listitem>
								<para>From the command prompt, run Pubimage.bat. This
									 inserts image values into the pub_info table.</para>
						  </listitem>
					 </orderedlist>

								<term>Reconcile</term> 
								<listitem> 
									 <para> The reconcile operator adds items in the
										  device to the Dataphor system catalog.</para> 
								</listitem> 
						  </varlistentry>

				<title>Libraries/Files Used</title> 
				<para> 
					 <variablelist> 
						  <varlistentry> 
								<term>Sample.Pubs</term> 
								<listitem> 
									 <para>By registering the Sample.Pubs library, the
										  MSSQLDevice will be created, the reconcile operator will be executed, and
										  references will be created.
										  <note>
												<para>It is assumed that the SQL server is
													 running on the same system as the Dataphor Server. If this is not the case the
													 create device expression will have to be changed before registering the
													 library.</para>

		  <title>Reconciliation</title> 
		  <para>Reconciliation allows Dataphor to add all the items on a device
				to the Dataphor system catalog. After reconciliation all the tables are
				available to view and modify the data.</para>
		  <para>Catalog objects added using reconsiliation are the same as any
				others. Anything that can be done to the tables and data added using
				reconciliation just like those created using Dataphor.</para>
