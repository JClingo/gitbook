[[DUGP3Security]]
== Summary

The Dataphor Server provides a complete role-based security model for
controlling access to the applications and resources defined in the
server. In addition to allowing access control to objects defined in the
system catalog, the security system allows developers to define
application-specific rights that are managed in the same way. This
allows a flexible and powerful security model that applications can not
only extend, but query to dynamically control user-interface appearance
based on security context.

[[DUGP3Security-SecurityPrimitives]]
== Security Primitives

There are three basic primitives in the Dataphor security model:

* Users
* Rights
* Roles

In general, rights and roles will be defined by the application
developer as part of the application. Ideally, roles will be made up of
non-overlapping groups of rights. Users can then be assigned to be
members of the appropriate set of roles by the system administrator. The
following sections discuss each type of object in detail.

[[DUGP3SecurityPrimitives-Users]]
=== Users

A user is the basic unit of authentication in the Dataphor Server. There
are two system-defined users: _System_ and __Admin__. The System user is
used by the Dataphor Server to perform system-level functions. Only the
Dataphor Server can login as the System user. The Admin user is the
central administrative user for the Dataphor Server. It is not possible
to revoke any right from the System or Admin users. For this reason,
care should be taken to guard access to the Admin user, as anyone
logging in with that user will have unrestricted access to the objects
in the Dataphor Server.

[[DUGP3SecurityPrimitives-Rights]]
=== Rights

A right is the basic unit of permission in the Dataphor Server. Any
operation which must be protected has an associated right. Rights are
then assigned to users and roles to allow users access to the various
objects and functions of the Dataphor Server. A right can be granted or
revoked, and a right assignment can be reverted. The Dataphor Server
defines several system rights which protect basic operations such as DDL
statements. Whenever a catalog object is created, the rights necessary
to protect operations on that object are also created. For example,
creating a table creates select, insert, update, and delete rights for
that table, as well as alter and drop rights. Although rights are not
catalog objects __per se__, they are part of the library in which they
were defined.

The Dataphor Server defines the following system rights that are not
associated with any catalog object:

* System.CreateType - Protects invocation of the create type statement.
* System.CreateTable - Protects invocation of the create table
statement.
* System.CreateView - Protects invocation of the create view statement.
* System.CreateOperator - Protects invocation of the create operator and
create aggregate operator statements.
* System.CreateDevice - Protects invocation of the create device
statement.
* System.CreateConstraint - Protects invocation of the create constraint
statement.
* System.CreateReference - Protects invocation of the create reference
statement.
* System.CreateRole - Protects invocation of the create role statement.
* System.CreateRight - Protects invocation of the create right
statement.
* System.CreateReference - Protects invocation of the create reference
statement.
* System.CreateUser - Protects the creation of users.
* System.AlterUser - Protects the administration of users.
* System.DropUser - Protects the deletion of users.
* System.MaintainSystemDeviceUsers - Protects maintenance of the system
device user mapping for devices. Without this right, a user cannot
specify the device-specific credentials for the system user for a given
device.
* System.MaintainUserSessions - Protects configuration of user sessions
through the System.Sessions and System.Processes catalog tables.
* System.HostImplementation - Protects the use of host implementation
structures. Without this right, a user cannot specify that a given D4
structure is implemented by a specified host implementation structure.

[[DUGP3SecurityPrimitives-Roles]]
=== Roles

A role is a group of right assignments in the Dataphor Server. The
Dataphor Server defines several system roles which it uses to manage
basic system rights. Users can be assigned to any number of roles. When
a user is a member of a role, the right assignments in that role are
applied to the user. A role is a catalog object with rights and
ownership.

The Dataphor Server defines the following roles:

* System.Admin
* System.User
* System.CatalogUser
* Security.SecurityUser
* Frontend.User
* Frontend.Developer

[[DUGP3Security-SecurityManagement]]
== Security Management

Management of users in the Dataphor Server is controlled through the
security rights for creating, altering and dropping users, as well as
the execute rights for the various security management operators.

The following operations are available to any given user of the Dataphor
Server:

* Create, Alter and Drop users, so long as the appropriate rights have
been granted.
* Manage right assignments in all roles owned by the user.
* Manage all catalog objects owned by the user.

[[DUGP3Security-CatalogObjectOwnership]]
== Catalog Object Ownership

Catalog object ownership specifies which user is responsible for
managing a particular object. Whenever a catalog object is created it is
owned by the user that created it. All rights for the object are
implicitly granted to the owner of the object. The owner of an object
can be changed using the SetObjectOwner operator.

[[DUGP3Security-DeterminationofRights]]
== Determination of Rights

All rights for a given object are implicitly granted to the owner of the
object. For example, the owner of a table can perform any operation
against that table. Whether or not a given user has been granted a right
is determined by the following rules:

* If the user has an explicit assignment for the right, the right is
granted or revoked according to the right assignment.
* If the roles which the user is a member of have an explicit assignment
for the right, the right is granted or revoked according to the most
restrictive right assignment of any role.
* If the user is the owner of the right, or the catalog object the right
is associated with, the right is considered granted.

According to these rules, the following points can be made:

* An explicit right assignment for the user will override any right
assignment made on any role that the user is a member of.
* If the roles that a user is a member of result in multiple assignments
for the same right, the most restrictive right assignment is used.
* It is possible to revoke the rights for an object that a given user
owns by using an explicit right assignment.

Rights determination is a compile-time function of the Dataphor Server.
This means that rights determination takes place when an object is
created, not when it is accessed. For example, if a view is created
which accesses a table that the user creating the view has access to,
and access permissions for the view are subsequently granted to a user
that does not have access to the table, the view will still function
correctly. In other words, operators and views provide an abstraction
over the security mechanism of the Dataphor Server.

Note also that this means that execute rights for event handlers do not
need to be granted, so long as the appropriate modification right has
been granted for the table in question, the event handler is considered
part of the table definition for the purposes of security management.

Because rights determination is done at compile-time, changes to the
rights of objects referenced by views and operators forces a recompile
of these objects. This update is handled automatically by the Dataphor
Server.

[[DUGP3Security-CatalogObjectRights]]
== Catalog Object Rights

Whenever a catalog object is created in the DAE, an appropriate set of
rights is also created to protect access to the object. The rights
created for each object type are as follows:

* Type - Alter, Drop
* Operator - Alter, Drop, Execute
* Table or View - Alter, Drop, Select, Insert, Update, Delete
* Device - Alter, Drop, Read, Write, CreateStore, AlterStore, DropStore,
Reconcile, MaintainUsers
* Constraint - Alter, Drop
* Reference - Alter, Drop
* Role - Alter, Drop

The created right is named by concatenating the name of the object with
the name of the right. For example, a table named Employee will have a
right named EmployeeSelect.

[[DUGP3Security-ManagingSecurity]]
== Managing Security

The Dataphor Server exposes all the functionality for managing the
security system through the Security API. The D4 language then includes
several shorthands for various calls in this API, and finally, the
Dataphoria environment exposes the functionality visually using the
Security library.

For information on the Security API, refer to
link:O-System.SecurityOperartors.html[Security Operators] in the System
Library Reference.

For information on the Security statements of D4, refer to
link:D4LGCatalogElements-Security.html[Security] in the Dataphor
Developer's Guide.
