In general, a database application is a data (or business) model, together with the information about
how it is to be presented and maintained. The business model is all the data and process logic of
interest to a particular enterprise or entity organized in a useful manner. This business model is
then manipulated and analyzed by users of the database application. One key goal of the Dataphor
product is to centralize the definition of the business model, and extend it with enough information
to make the process of presentation as automatic as possible. In a Dataphor application, this
extended business model is called the application schema.

Developing a Dataphor application involves designing the application schema, and describing it to
the Dataphor Server. This description is expressed in a programming language called D4. This
language is a full-featured programming language that includes complete data management and
manipulation functionality, as well as capabilities for describing and managing the application
schema.

== Components of a Dataphor Application

The various components of an Application Schema can be loosely grouped
into the following categories:

* Structure
* Business Rules
* Process Logic
* Metadata
* Presentation Layer
* Physical Layer

The structural elements of a Dataphor Application constitute the core of
the data model. They include the data types, tables and views that are
used to describe the data involved with the model.

The business rules in a Dataphor Application determine the legal values
of data in the database. Business rules ensure that the data conforms to
the requirements for the applications. These include everything from
simple constraints that enforce valid values for the columns of tables,
to referential integrity constraints and other multi-table constraints,
to complex stimulus-response rules invoked in response to events
occurring within the system.

Application processes that involve sequences of actions to be taken, or
work-flows, are modelled with process logic in a Dataphor application
schema. These elements consist of pre-compiled statements of D4 that
accomplish some task, and can be invoked either by the users of the
application, or as the result of a stimulus-response rule.

Metadata in a Dataphor Application allows application-specific
information to be attached to the data model. This includes presentation
layer information such as titles for user-interface elements, as well as
hints for controlling how user-interfaces should be built from the
application schema.

The presentation layer elements of a Dataphor Application describe the
user-interfaces required to manipulate the data in the data model.
Because the Dataphor platform enables a high level of automation, the
majority of the user-interfaces required by the presentation layer can
be built as needed based on the information contained in the application
schema.

In order to persist the data described by the application schema, the
elements of the physical layer describe the mapping between the
structural elements of the application schema and the tables and views
in external database systems that actually persist the data.

== Implementation of a Dataphor Application

he concrete implementation of a Dataphor Application involves
describing all the components discussed in the previous section in a
running Dataphor Server instance. Application schemas in the Dataphor
Server are exposed using the following concepts:

* Catalog
* Libraries
* Documents

The catalog of a Dataphor Server contains the definitions for all the
objects in the data model. These objects include data types, tables,
views, business rules, process logic, security roles, and storage
devices. In addition, the catalog contains any metadata associated with
these objects.

Libraries within a Dataphor Server provide a logical grouping for
catalog objects. They are a deployment unit for application schemas, and
allow the architecture of a Dataphor Application to be segmented into
manageable units of related schema elements. Many of the capabilities
provided by the Dataphor platform are built as libraries such as
Frontend and MSSQLDevice. In addition to utilizing various system
libraries, a typical Dataphor Application will consist of several
interrelated libraries.

Dataphor libraries also contain various documents that essentially
constitute the "source code" for the library. These include D4 scripts
that are used to "install" the application by constructing the initial
state of the catalog, as well as user-interface definitions and
customizations stored as Dataphor Form Documents.

== Data Access Layer (DAL)

At the lowest level, all communication with the Dataphor Server is
performed through the Call-Level Interface (CLI). Although developers
can communicate directly with the Dataphor Server through this CLI, it
is usually advantageous to utilize the high-level Data Access Components
(DAC) provided with Dataphor.

The Data Access Components are a set of components and controls built in
Microsoft C# that provide a high-level wrapper for communication with
the Dataphor Server. They manage client-side buffering and state
management, as well as data-binding to visual controls such as text
boxes and grids. These components form the basis for connectivity in the
Windows and Web clients, as well as the forms layer in Windows-based
applications like Dataphoria or the Windows Client.

== Hosting a Dataphor Server

The Dataphor Server can be hosted in a Microsoft Windows Service, or
within a .NET application domain, typically within the Dataphoria IDE.

When running as a Microsoft Windows Service, the Dataphor Server can be
started and stopped from the Windows service control manager (services
snap-in), or by using the Dataphor Service Configuration Utility.

The Dataphor Service Configuration Utility is a .NET application for
configuring and maintaining the Dataphor Service instance on a
particular machine. It provides interfaces to stop and start the
Dataphor service as well as change configuration options for the
service.

== Deploying a Dataphor Application

ecause the Dataphor Server is essentially "middleware", it can be
deployed in a variety of different scenarios. Conceptually, a Dataphor
deployment consists of the following roles:

* Dataphor Server
* Storage Device(s)
* Web Client Server (optional)
* Windows Client

In the simplest deployment scenario, all these components can be run on
the same physical machine. In the most demanding enterprise
environments, each of these roles can be filled by a load-balanced,
fault-tolerant cluster of machines. Due to the flexibility of the
architecture, Dataphor Applications can be scaled anywhere in-between
these two extremes as necessary.

A typical development scenario consists of:

* Storage system such as Microsoft SQL Server running on the development
machine, or a development server.
* Dataphor Server running in-process within a Dataphoria IDE running on
the development machine.

Of course there are other issues such as versioning and source control
that must be taken into account in a development scenario, especially
when considering a team development environment. These and other
development issues are discussed at length in the Dataphor Developer's
Guide.

A typical client-server deployment scenario consists of:

* Dataphor Server running as a service on the "Server" machine.
* Storage system such as Microsoft SQL Server running on the "Server"
machine.
* Dataphor Windows Client installed on each "Client" machine accessing
the "Server".

In order to provide a web-based client in this scenario, the Web Client
Server can be deployed on the "Server" machine.

A typical n-tier deployment scenario consists of:

* Dataphor Server running as a service on a dedicated machine or
cluster.
* Storage system running on a dedicated machine or cluster.
* Web Client Server running on a dedicated machine or cluster.

These example scenarios illustrate the typical software and hardware
environment for a Dataphor Application.
