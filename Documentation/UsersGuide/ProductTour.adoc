== Introduction

In order to achieve a more declarative application development platform,
Dataphor provides an environment for describing applications in terms of
the core structures and logic required. These descriptions are called
__application schemas__ and are stored and maintained
centrally. These application schemas can then be mapped onto existing
database systems to provide storage and integration capabilities, and
consumed by Dataphor clients to provide the presentation layer of the
application.

This chapter provides an overview of what the Dataphor product is, and
how it enables declarative development using the concept of an
application schema. The first section provides an architectural overview
of the product, introducing the components of the architecture. Each
component is then considered in detail in the following sections.

This chapter is intended to be read by Dataphor developers and
administrators, and provides a big-picture overview of the entire
product. No prior knowledge of the Dataphor platform is necessary to
understand the material covered in this chapter.
