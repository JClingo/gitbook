[[DUGP1Client-SideBufferingControls]]
== Introduction
Buffering ControlsClient-Side Buffering Controls

The CLI performs client-side buffering of result sets to minimize
network round trips. There are two properties that control various
aspects of this buffering mechanism, FetchAtOpen and FetchCount. Once
the session is connected, changing these settings has no affect.

[[DUGP1FetchAtOpen]]
== FetchAtOpen

The FetchAtOpen property determines whether the results of the open call
will fetch the initial buffer. This property is used by the Frontend
Clients to minimize network round trips.

The default value for this property is false.

[[DUGP1FetchCount]]
== FetchCount

The FetchCount property determines the size in rows of the client-side
buffer.

The default value for this setting is 20. Setting the value of this
property to 1 effectively disables client-side buffering.
