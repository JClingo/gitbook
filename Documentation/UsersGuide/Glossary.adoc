[[DUGGlossary]]
== Summary

The Dataphor glossary provides definitions for potentially unfamiliar terms the user may come across in using Dataphor and reading its documentation.

=== Terms

[horizontal]
AAD::
  Automated Application Development. The name given to the paradigm of
  development enabled by the Dataphor Platform. AAD focuses on
  describing "what" an application needs to do, rather than "how" it
  does it.
Accessor::
  An operator used to access the individual components, or properties,
  of a given logical representation.
ACID::
  A mnemonic device for the basic characteristics of a transaction:
  Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
Action::
  The name given to the category of components that are used to execute
  various commands within definition of forms within the Frontend.
Aggregate Operator::
  An operator with a specialized calling convention that allows
  aggregate operations to be computed efficiently.
Application Schema::
  The structure and metadata definitions of a Dataphor application. This
  information is used by the Frontend Server to derive user-interfaces.
Application Transaction::
  A long-running optimistically concurrent transaction which is managed
  by the Dataphor Server. Updates are maintained in a transparent data
  cache until the transaction is committed.
Atomicity::
  The idea that a transaction must behave as a single unit of work. It
  must either all be applied, or all be rolled back.

Base Table Variable::
  A table variable defined in terms of its structure, i.e. columns,
  keys, etc.,. This is in constrast to a derived table variable, which
  is defined in terms of a table-valued expression.
BOP::
  Basic Object Persistence. A serialization mechanism used internally by
  the Dataphor toolset to persist object state.
Business Rules::
  A general term describing the requirements of a particular business.
  In other words, the constraints which must be enforced on the
  database.

Catalog::
  The structures describing the schema that is available within a
  Dataphor Server.
CLI::
  Call-Level Interface. An Application Programming Interface (API)
  designed specifically for use in accessing a database management
  system. The Dataphor Server exposes all functionality through the CLI.
Commit::
  The successful completion of a transaction. The transaction manager
  ensures that the resources used by the transaction are released as
  part of the commit, and that the changes made by the transaction are
  made permanent in the database.
Component::
  The name given to all components and controls used in the definition
  of forms in the Frontend.
Concurrency::
  The ability of a system to service multiple requests to the same
  resources at the same time. A high degree of concurrency is desirable
  in database systems.
Consistency::
  The idea that a transaction transforms a database from one consistent
  state to another, without necessarily maintaining consistency within
  the transaction. A consistent state means specifically that all
  integrity constraints are satisfied.
Constraint::
  A component of the logical data model consisting of an arbitrary
  truth-valued expression which must evaluate to true at transaction
  boundaries.
  +
  Also, a truth-valued expression used to describe the set of legal
  values for a scalar type.
Control::
  The name given to all visual components used in the definition of
  forms in the Frontend. All controls are components, but not all
  components are controls.
Conveyor::
  A host-implementation construct used to translate values between their
  physical representation and their host representation.
Cursor::
  An implementation construct used to provide row-at-a-time access to
  the result set of a given table-valued expression. Cursors are used
  extensively within the Dataphor Server, and provide the basic
  mechanism for data retrieval through the CLI.
Cursor Capabilities::
  The groups of behavior available for a cursor such as navigable,
  backwards navigable, and updatable. For a complete description of
  cursor capabilities, see the D4 Language Guide.
Cursor Isolation Level::
  The isolation level associated with a given cursor. In conjunction
  with the isolation level for the transaction in which the cursor is
  participating, determines how the cursor should interact with other
  cursors and transactions running on the system. For a complete list of
  available cursor isolation levels, see the D4 Language Guide.
  +
  See Isolation Level.
Cursor Type::
  A desription of the characteristics of a cursor with respect to
  changes made to the database since the cursor was opened. A static
  cursor is immune to changes in the database, while a dynamic cursor
  can see updates made to the database, so long as the cursor and
  transaction isolation levels allow it.

D4::
  D4 is the database access language used to communicate with the
  Dataphor Server. D4 provides a complete relational algebra for
  manipulating data, as well as a rich type system for describing even
  the most complex data. D4 is also computationally complete, and
  supports a full complement of flow control constructs, including
  exception handling, to provide a complete development language with
  data manipulation capabilities.
DAE::
  Data Access Engine. The name given to the query processor subsystem of
  the Dataphor Server.
Data Definition Language (DDL)::
  A category of statements in a database language which allow data
  structures to be defined and manipulated.
Data Integrity::
  See Integrity.
Data Manipulation Language (DML)::
  A category of statements in a database language which allow data to be
  retrieved and manipulated.
Data Mining::
  The act of probing a database searching for information which may be
  manifested as trends in the data.
Data Model::
  1.  A logical abstraction of data which allows the modeling of general
  characteristics of all data.
  2.  The logical abstraction of all the data of interest to a
  particular enterprise or entity. Also called a business model when
  used in this sense.
Data Warehousing::
  The act of gathering data from distributed locations in a single
  store, usually in some aggregated form for further analysis.
Database::
  An organized collection of facts.
Database Management System (DBMS)::
  A computer system specifically designed to store and maintain data.
Dataphoria::
  The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the Dataphor
  platform. Dataphoria is used to develop, maintain, and administer
  Dataphor applications.
Dataphor Server::
  The DBMS portion of the Dataphor toolset. An instance of a Dataphor
  Server can be hosted within a running Dataphoria, or as a service.
Derivation::
  The process of constructing a user-interface based on the structural
  information available in the application schema for particular table,
  view, or table-valued expression.
Derived Table Variable::
  A table variable which is defined in terms of an expression involving
  other table variables. Also called a view. This is in contrast to a
  base table variable which is defined in terms of its structure.
Device::
  The Dataphor Server utilizes a highly abstracted storage model that
  allows virtually any data source to be used as a storage device. A
  storage device may wrap a popular SQL-based industry DBMS, or simply
  wrap a comma delimited text file.
DIL::
  Dataphor Interface Language. An XML format for describing
  user-interfaces independent of the platform on which they will be
  realized.
DILX::
  DIL Transform Language. An XML format used to store the difference
  between two DIL documents.
Durability::
  The idea that once a transaction has been committed to the database,
  the results of that transaction are permanent. In other words, the
  effects of the transaction will persist even in the event of a system
  failure or other catastrophe.

Elaboration::
  The process of using the business model to derive a meaningful
  expression to manipulate the contents of a given query. Elaboration is
  used by the Frontend Server to derive user-interfaces from the
  application schema.
Event::
  System or user event that fires in response to some occurrence such as
  a data modification or proposable call.
Event Handler::
  An operator which is assigned to be invoked when a particular event is
  fired.
Execution Plan::
  The general term for a prepared plan in the Dataphor Server containing
  the executable code necessary to perform the operations specified in a
  D4 request. Plans are created in response to user requests coming in
  through the CLI.
Expression::
  A statement of D4 that evaluates to a value of some type.
Expression Plan::
  A prepared plan in the Dataphor Server containing the executable code
  necessary to evaluate a single expression of D4.
  +
  See Execution Plan

Frontend::
  The Dataphor Frontend is an Interface Abstraction Layer that provides
  a uniform view of presentation. The Frontend describes interfaces
  using an XML based language called Dataphor Interface Language (DIL).
Frontend Server::
  The server-side components of the Dataphor Frontend responsible for
  the application layer extensions to the Dataphor Server such as
  documents, query elaboration, and user-interface derivation.

Host-Implemented Operator::
  An operator of D4 whose implementation is provided by a .NET class.
  For more information on host-implemented operators, see the DAE
  Developer's Guide, Part II.

Impedance Mismatch::
  A term typically used to describe the disparity arising between the
  language used to query the database, (normally SQL) and the language
  used to code the business processes in the layers above the database,
  such as C, C++, Pascal, etc. Dataphor applications do not suffer from
  this type of impedance mismatch because the language used to query the
  data is also used to code the business processes.
Integrity::
  The correctness, or accuracy, of the data in the database. The tables
  in a relational database can be viewed as having a predicate where
  each column is a placeholder. This predicate represents the meaning of
  the data in the table. Each row in the table can then be viewed as a
  proposition by substituting each placeholder with the value for the
  corresponding column in that row. The resulting proposition is
  considered true. Therefore, a relational database is quite literally a
  collection of true propositions, or facts. Integrity refers to this
  concept of truth in the database.
Integrity Constraint::
  See Constraint.
Isolation::
  The idea that a given process runs as though it is the only one in a
  given system, even though there may be multiple processes actually
  running. Isolation is typically enforced by locking.
Isolation Level::
  The degree of isolation associated with a particular transaction. The
  degree of isolation is inversely proportional to the degree of
  concurrency. In other words, the higher the isolation level, the lower
  the concurrency, and vice versa. An important result of isolation
  theory states that if all transactions run at least Degree 1 isolation
  (also called browse, or read uncommitted) then no transaction running
  at a lower isolation level will interfere with transactions running at
  higher isolation levels.

Key::
  A set of columns in a table variable which constitute a unique
  identifier for every row in the table. Note that a key may contain no
  columns, as well as multiple columns. In effect, a key states that no
  two rows in the table variable for which it is defined are allowed to
  have the same values for all the columns of the key. Note also that
  keys are inferred for derived table variables.
Key Inference::
  The process by which the compiler determines the set of keys that hold
  within the result of a given table-valued expression. This information
  is used by the compiler and distributed query processor to perform
  semantic optimization, as well as by the Frontend to perform query
  elaboration and user-interface derivation.

List (Value)::
  A list in the Dataphor Server is an ordered collection of values, all
  of the same type.
Logical Data Independence::
  The idea that an external user's perception of the database can remain
  unaffected by changes in the logical model, largely due to the
  interchangeability of base and derived relations.
Logical Model::
  An abstract construction used to describe the characteristics and
  behavior of some system.

Metadata::
  Data or information about the data contained in a database.
Metadata Inference::
  The process by which the compiler determines the metadata that applies
  to the result set of a given table-valued expression. This information
  is used by the Dataphor Server, as well as the Frontend Server to
  perform functions such as query elaboration and user-interface
  derivation.

Native Accessor::
  A host-implementation mechanism used to retrieve and specify values in
  the host-implementation language.
Native Representation::
  See Representation
Navigational Access::
  A service exposed by the Dataphor Server that enables efficient
  searching and navigation against data in a relational database.
Nested Transaction::
  A transaction which is running within some other transaction.
Nil::
  A marker used to indicate that a given variable does not currently
  have a value.
Normalization::
  Normalization refers to the process of decomposing a set of relations
  using projection to eliminate potential redundancy.

Operator::
  A component of the logical data model describing how data of arbitrary
  types should be manipulated.
Orthogonality::
  The property of a language that describes how well different concepts
  in the language interact with each other. Orthogonality in a language
  helps to eliminate special-case scenarios, making the language easier
  to learn and use, as well as more flexible and powerful.

Physical Data Independence::
  The idea that the logical data model can remain unaffected by changes
  at the physical level.
Plan::
  See Execution Plan.
Predicate Logic::
  A system of logic in which a proposition is allowed to contain
  placeholders. These parameterized propositions are called predicates.
  Each place holder is allowed to range over a domain (or type) of
  values. Substituting values for these domains in each placeholder
  results in a truth-valued proposition.
Property::
  An individual component of a logical representation of a scalar type.
  Each property has an associated read and write accessor which allows
  the value of the property to be accessed and manipulated
  independently.
Proposable Interface::
  The Proposable interface allows the application to perform
  intermediate processing while data entry is occurring, where rows are
  built a column at a time as the user enters data.

Query Processor::
  That portion of a Database Management System which is responsible for
  producing the results of a given query.

Reconciliation::
  The process by which the Dataphor Server synchronizes catalog objects
  with a given device. For more information on this process see Part IV
  of the Dataphor Developer's Guide.
Reference::
  A component of the logical data model used to enforce referential
  integrity.
Reference Inference::
  The process by which the compiler determines the references that apply
  to the result of a given table-valued expression. This information is
  used by the Frontend Server during query elaboration and
  user-interface derivation.
Referential Integrity::
  A special type of integrity referring to the relationships between
  tables. Specifically, a referential integrity constraint says that if
  a given row is in some table, it must have a corresponding row in some
  table (not necessarily a different table). A reference (also called a
  foreign key) is used to enforce referential integrity.
Relation Type::
  A relation type defines the type of relation values. It consists of a
  heading, which is a set of attributes of the form <name : type>.
Relation (Value)::
  A relation consists of a heading: a set of attributes of the form
  <name : type> of which <name> must be unique in the set, and a body: a
  set of tuples, containing a component for each attribute of the body
  of the form <name : value> in which <value> is a value of the type for
  attribute <name>. Relation is the formal name for the data structure
  used in the relational model. Table is the informal name used by the
  DAE.
Relation Variable::
  A variable whose value is a relation value. Tables and views are both
  relation variables. Tables are base relation variables, where views
  are derived relation variables.
Relational Algebra::
  A set of manipulative operators used to derive new relations from
  existing ones. The five primitive operators of the relational algebra
  are restriction, projection, union, difference, and either
  intersection or join. Each of these operators is closed over
  relations, meaning that the result of each operator is a relation, and
  can therefore be used as the argument to the next operator.
Relational Calculus::
  A computational system for manipulating relations which is equivalent
  to the relational algebra. Queries in a relational calculus are
  formulated by describing the desired result set, rather than
  describing the steps to construct it.
Relational Model::
  A formal theory of data consisting of three major components: (a) A
  structural aspect, meaning that data in the database is perceived as
  tables, and only tables, (b) An integrity aspect, meaning that those
  tables satisfy certain integrity constraints, and (c) A manipulative
  aspect, meaning that the tables can be operated upon by means of
  operators which derive tables from tables.
Representation::
  A general term used to describe the representation of values of types.
  There are several categories of representations within the Dataphor
  Platform:
  +
  * Physical Representation
  +
  The physical representation of a value is the byte encoding of that
  value suitable for storage in the physical layer of the DAE.
  * Device Representation
  +
  The device representation of a value is the value as it appears at the
  connectivity implementation boundary. This is the way a value appears
  as it is first presented to the DAE from a device. This is also the
  representation as it appears when it is handed back to the device
  through the connectivity implementation.
  * Native Representation
  +
  The native representation of a value in the host implementation
  language of the Dataphor Server, namely a .NET representation of the
  value. For example, the native representation of values of type
  `System.Integer` is as a value of type `Int32` in the .NET Framework.
  * Logical Representation
  +
  The logical representation of a value in D4. A given type may have
  multiple logical representations exposed through accessors in the D4
  language.
  * Presentation Representation
  +
  The representation of a value of some type in a user interface (also
  called the Frontend representation). A given type may also have
  multiple presentation representations such as a display
  representation, and an edit representation. Note that any given
  presentation representation is always a logical representation, but
  not every logical representation is available as a presentation
  representation.
Rollback::
  The unsuccessful completion of a transaction. The transaction manager
  ensures that all changes made by the transaction are undone during
  this process.
Row (Value)::
  A row value is a set of named columns, where each column describes the
  type of values that may appear in the column, and has a value from
  that type.

Scalar Type::
  A named set of values having no user-visible components. Scalar types
  are a component of the logical data model used to describe the type of
  data to be stored.
Scalar (Value)::
  A value with no user-visible components.
Schema::
  The system definition of the structure of the objects contained within
  the database, including types, operators, constraints, tables, views,
  devices, etc.,.
Script::
  A program of D4 usually contained in a text file. A script specifies a
  sequence of operations to be performed. For example, a script may
  contain the data definition language statements necessary to create a
  particular business model.
Selector::
  An operator which 'selects' a value of some domain. Each logical
  representation of a scalar type has an associated selector which
  allows values of the domain to be constructed based on the values for
  the components, or properties, of the representation.
SIA::
  Storage Integration Architecture. The name given to the technology
  which provides the storage abstraction layer in the Dataphor Server.
Sparse Key::
  A key which is defined to ignore columns that do not contain values
  for all the columns of the key. This is in contrast to a normal key,
  in which rows that do not contain values for the columns of the key
  are considered equivalent.
Special Value::
  A value of a domain which is assigned special significance by the type
  designer. This special value can then be used by the application to
  specify that a given piece of information is missing, or unknown.
Statement::
  The basic unit of execution within the D4 language. All programs of D4
  are built using blocks of statements.
Statement Plan::
  A prepared plan in the Dataphor Server containing the executable code
  for a single statement of the D4 language.
  +
  See Execution Plan.
Storage Device::
  See Device.
Storage Integration Architecture (SIA)::
  A subsystem of the Dataphor Server designed to allow data from any
  source to be accessed and manipulated from the Dataphor Server.
System-Provided Operator::
  An operator whose definition is provided by the system. This term is
  used to refer both to operators that are built-in as part of the
  system libraries, and to operators whose definition is provided as
  part of the compilation process, such as selectors and accessors for
  system-provided representations.
System-Provided Representation::
  The logical representation of a scalar type that is provided
  automatically by the compiler. When a representation is
  system-provided, it also corresponds to the physical representation
  for the type.

Table::
  A base table variable in the catalog of the DAE. Note that the term
  table is often used very loosely to mean a table variable in some
  contexts, and a table value in others.
Table (Value)::
  A table value in the DAE consists of a set of named columns, where
  each column defines the domain of values that may appear within the
  column, and a set of rows where each row has the same columns as the
  table, and a value for each column from the column domain.
Table Variable::
  A variable whose value is a table value specifically. The term is used
  to refer to both base and derived table variables.
Tags::
  Pieces of metadata that can be associated with objects in the catalog.
  These tags have no meaning within the logical model, but are
  interpreted by applications using the Dataphor Server.
Transaction::
  The basic unit of work in a database management system. Transactions
  are used to ensure that user requests are handled fairly, effectively,
  and consistently throughout the system. In order to ensure the
  correctness of each transaction, transactions must have the ACID
  properties. See ACID.
Transaction Management::
  The process by which transactions from multiple users are coordinated
  within a single system. Transaction management involves scheduling
  access to shared resources to ensure that all actions taken against
  the system have consistent effects.
Tuple (Value)::
  A tuple consists of a heading: a set of attributes of the form <name :
  domain> of which <name> must be unique in the set, and a value for
  each attribute where the value must be a member of the domain of the
  attribute. Tuple is the formal name for the row concept in the
  relational model. Row is the informal name used within the Dataphor
  Server.
Type::
  A type is a named set of values. The Dataphor Server uses types to
  ensure the correctness of the operations requested in D4. For more
  information on types, refer to the D4 Language Guide.
Type Inference::
  The mechanism by which the Dataphor Server is able to determine the
  result type of a given expression.

User-Interface Derivation::
  See Derivation

Value::
  A value is a constant with no location in space or time. Values, by
  definition, are immutable.
Variable::
  A variable is a placeholder for a value. A variable does have a
  location in space and time. Variables are mutable, in that the current
  value of the variable may be changed to a new value.
View::
  A derived table variable in the logical model of the Dataphor Server.
View Updatability::
  The name given to the problem of determining how a given modification
  statement targeting a view should be propagated to the table variables
  involved in that view definition.
