[[DUGP1Dataphoria-DataphorExplorer]]
== Summary

The Dataphor Explorer provides a hierarchical representation of the
entire catalog of the Dataphor Server. Each level of the tree exposes
different types of functionality. This functionality is accessible by
right-clicking on a node to show the context menu for that node of the
tree. It is important to note that all the functionality exposed by
Dataphoria is available as operators and statements of the D4 language.
Dataphoria simply provides a visual interface to enhance the
productivity of a developer working with the platform. The following
sections consider each type of node in the tree.

== Server

The server node is the root node of the Dataphor Explorer, and exposes
the functionality available for the entire server.

Choosing UpgradeÂ Libraries traverses the catalog in library-dependency
order and ensures that any outstanding upgrades have been applied.
Selecting this menu option is equivalent to invoking the operator
UpgradeLibraries with no parameters.
