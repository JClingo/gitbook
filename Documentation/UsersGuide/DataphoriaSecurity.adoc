model of the Dataphor Server. The Security node displays the Users as
child nodes:

Right-clicking on the Security node and selecting the Manage Users
command displays the following user interface:

This user interface allows for the administration of all users. Note
that the capabilities available from this form still require an
appropriate authorization check. If a user with access to this form does
not have the rights to perform a particular operation, an error message
will be displayed.

[[DUGP1Users]]
== Users

The Manage Users form provides for the management of all users in the
system. The following screen capture displays the User Edit form:

The User ID is the case-insensitive identifier for the user within the
Dataphor Server. This is the User ID used when logging in to the server
from the Dataphor Server Login form, or when using a configured alias.

The Name is the display name for the user, and is not used by the
Dataphor Server.

Password is case-sensitive and the entry is masked. The Confirm Password
entry is used to guarantee correctness of the password. The Password and
Confirm Password must match before the form can be accepted.

the currently selected user. These mappings provide deivce-specific

[[DUGP1UserRoles]]
=== User Roles

currently selected user belongs. For more information on roles and other
