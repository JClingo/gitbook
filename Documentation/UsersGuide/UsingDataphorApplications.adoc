== Summary

This chapter discusses the Dataphor Frontend Clients that provide the
user-interface for Dataphor Applications. Dataphor applications
typically have at least a Microsoft Windows user-interface, and a Web
user-interface. Regardless of the style of user-interface, the overall
look-and-feel of the application is the same.

This chapter is intended to be read by anyone using a Dataphor
application. No prior knowledge of the Dataphor platform is assumed in
the material covered.
