The simple device is a memory device with the added ability 
to persist the data in files on the Dataphor Server local 
storage media.  The Simple Device, while it will persist the 
data, is only intended for small amounts data that do not require 
concurrent access.

===============================================

EXAMPLE:

MemoryDevice Example:

  create device TempDevice
   class "System.MemoryDevice";

SimpleDevice Example:

  create device DataDevice
    reconciliation { mode = { Command }, master = device }
    class "SimpleDevice"
      attributes
      {
        "DirectoryName" = "c:\Data",
        "AutoSave" = "true"
      };

In this example:
 The name of the device is "DataDevice".
 The reconciliation mode is "Command".
 The reconciliation master is "device".
 The class is "SimpleDevice".
 The data files will be stored in the C:\Data directory.
 The data will be save each time any change takes place
  because of the Autosave being set to true.

Dataphor Reference under Libraries, SimpleDevice.
