This script registers the Sample.Demo library and
executes the Base.d4 script.  The Base.d4 script creates
the differnt types that this library uses as well
as a few operators before the creation of any tables, constraints
or events.
*/

ExecuteScript('Sample.Demo', 'Base');

/*
After running the Register.d4 script, the following
scripts should be run in the order seen below:

//*
ExecuteScript('Sample.Demo', 'Tables');
//This script creates the tables that the Sample.Demo library will use.

ExecuteScript('Sample.Demo', 'Views');
//This script creates the different views used by the Sample.Demo library.

ExecuteScript('Sample.Demo', 'Events');
//This script creates the different Events used by the Sample.Demo library.

ExecuteScript('Sample.Demo', 'Constraints');
//This script creates the user-defined constraints used in Sample.Demo

ExecuteScript('Sample.Demo', 'Data');
//This script inserts sample data for use in the Sample.Demo library.

ExecuteScript('Sample.Demo', 'CreateApplication');
//This script creates an application with the MainForm as the entry point.
//*

If you wish to create the Sample.Demo library utilizing a SQL Server Device then 
we advise that you bypass the scripts outlined above and  
run the Device.d4 script instead.  The Device.d4 script will create a SQL Server device,
run the scripts outlined above, and create the type mappings for SQL server.

Other scripts contained within the Sample.Demo library are as follows:

Integrate.d4 - this script, when using the SQLServer Device, integrates data from
the "Pubs" database in SQL Server into the Organization table of Sample.Demo

Mappings.d4 - this script is utilized by the Device.d4 script to create type 
mappings fromt he user-defined types in Sample.Demo to SQL Server.

MapFormatName.d4 - this script is utilized by Mappings.d4 to map the formatted name.
