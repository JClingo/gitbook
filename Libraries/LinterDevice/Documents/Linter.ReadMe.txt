The LinterDevice provided with Dataphor provides a device for 
communicating with Linter SQL Server.

This LinterDevice is a BETA version!

===============================================

EXAMPLE:

create device Linter
 reconciliation { mode = { command }, master = device }
 class "LinterDevice"
  attributes
  {
   "DataSource" = "LinterServer"
  };
		
CreateDeviceUser("System", "Linter", "SYSTEM", "LinterPassword");
CreateDeviceUser("Admin", "Linter", "SYSTEM", "LinterPassword");

In this example:
 The name of the device is "Linter".
 The reconciliation mode is "command".
 The reconciliation master is "device".
 The class is "LinterDevice".
 The data will be stored on the Linter server
  running under the name of LinterServer.

 Two Dataphor users are created, both are mapped to the
  Linter server user named SYSTEM.
