The SASDevice provided with Dataphor provides a device for 
communicating with SAS SQL Server.

This SASDevice is a BETA version!

===============================================

EXAMPLE:

create device SAS
 reconciliation { mode = { command }, master = device }
 class "SASDevice"
  attributes
  {
   "Location" = "SASLocation",
   "ServerID" = "SASServer"
  };
		
CreateDeviceUser("System", "SAS", "SYSTEM", "SASPassword");
CreateDeviceUser("Admin", "SAS", "SYSTEM", "SASPassword");

In this example:
 The name of the device is "SAS".
 The reconciliation mode is "command".
 The reconciliation master is "device".
 The class is "SASDevice".
 The data will be stored on the SAS server
  running under the name of SASServer
  which is running at the SASLocation.

 Two Dataphor users are created, both are mapped to the
  SAS server user named SYSTEM.
