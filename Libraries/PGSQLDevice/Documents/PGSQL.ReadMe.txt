The PGSQL Device provided with Dataphor provides a device 
for communicating with PostgreSQL versions 8.3 thru 9.4.

===============================================

EXAMPLES

This is the simplest use case that defaults to using a Postgres server on
the localhost, authenticating with the stock user "postgres", and
connecting to the stock database "postgres".  Simply installing the
Postgres server+client software on the localhost is enough prerequisite for
it to work.

	create device PGSQLTestDevice
		reconciliation { mode = { command }, master = device }
		class "PostgreSQLDevice";

	CreateDeviceUser("System", "PGSQLTestDevice", "postgres", "the_password");
	CreateDeviceUser("Admin", "PGSQLTestDevice", "postgres", "the_password");

	EnsureDeviceStarted("PGSQLTestDevice");

This is the more general use case where the used Postgres server may be on
any host, and we may be connecting as any user to any database.

	create device PGSQLTestDevice
		reconciliation { mode = { command }, master = device }
		class "PostgreSQLDevice"
		attributes
		{
			"Server" = "my.http.domain.or.ip",
			"Database" = "my_database_name"
		};

	CreateDeviceUser("System", "PGSQLTestDevice", "my_username", "the_password");
	CreateDeviceUser("Admin", "PGSQLTestDevice", "my_username", "the_password");

	EnsureDeviceStarted("PGSQLTestDevice");

In these examples:
 The name of the device is "PGSQLTestDevice".
 The reconciliation mode is "command".
 The reconciliation master is "device".
 The class is "PostgreSQLDevice"

More documentation may be pending.
