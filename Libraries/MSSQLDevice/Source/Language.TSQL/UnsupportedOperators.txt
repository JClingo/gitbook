Operators not supported in the MSSQL device:


LibraryReference Operators
   The LibraryReference selector/accessor operators and any operator that take an argument of type 
   LibraryReference are not supported by the MSSQL device. This date type is not currently supported 
   for the MSSQL device.

LibraryDescriptor Operators
   The LibraryDescriptor selector/accessor operators and any operator that take an argument of type 
   LibraryDescriptor are not supported by the MSSQL device. This date type is not currently supported 
   for the MSSQL device.

FileReference Operators
   The LibraryDescriptor selector/accessor operators and any operator that take an argument of type 
   LibraryDescriptor are not supported by the MSSQL device. This date type is not currently supported 
   for the MSSQL device.

System.IsUpper(System.String)
   MSSQL provides no function to evaluate the case of a string. Also there is no way of iterating 
   through a string to evaluate each character within an expression.

System.IsLower(System.String)
   MSSQL provides no function to evaluate the case of a string. Also there is no way of iterating 
   through a string to evaluate each character within an expression.

System.PadLeft(System.String, System.Integer)
   MSSQL does not provide an equivalent function and there is no method for adding characters recursively
   until the length is equal to that specified by the second parameter within an expression. 

System.PadLeft(System.String, System.Integer, System.String)
   MSSQL does not provide an equivalent function and there is no method for adding characters recursively
   until the length is equal to that specified by the second parameter within an expression. 

System.PadRight(System.String, System.Integer, System.String)
   MSSQL does not provide an equivalent function and there is no method for adding characters recursively
   until the length is equal to that specified by the second parameter within an expression. 

System.IsLetter(System.String)
   It is not possible to iterate through a string within an expression in order to evaluate each index 
   of the string individually.

System.IsDigit(System.String)
   It is not possible to iterate through a string within an expression in order to evaluate each index
   of the string individually.

System.Math.Factorial(System.Integer)
   Recursion which is necessary is not possible within an expression.

System.Math.Random(System.Integer)  

System.Math.Random(System.Integer, System.Integer)

System.Math.Seed()

System.Math.Seed(System.Integer)

System.All(System.Boolean)
   MSSQL has no support for the Boolean data type.

System.Any(System.Boolean)
   MSSQL has no support for the Boolean data type.
   
System.Compatible(System.VersionNumber, System.VersionNumber)
   Cannot be implemented within and expression and there is not currently a function written for this operator
   in the MSSQL device.
   
System.VersionNumber.AsString(System.String)
   A while loop is required for the translation which is not possible in an expression. This operator will
   require a function to be written which is not currently written which is why it is not supported at this time.
   Most operations concerning VersionNumber will not be performed on the serverside anyhow. 

System.VersionNumber.ReadAsString(System.VersionNumber)
   A while loop is required for the translation which is not possible in an expression. This operator will
   require a function to be written which is not currently written which is why it is not supported at this time.
   Most operations concerning VersionNumber will not be performed on the serverside anyhow. 

System.VersionNumber.WriteAsString(System.VersionNumber, System.String)
   A while loop is required for the translation which is not possible in an expression. This operator will
   require a function to be written which is not currently written which is why it is not supported at this time.
   Most operations concerning VersionNumber will not be performed on the serverside anyhow. 

System.ToTimeSpan(System.String)
   The function to parse a string and convert to the expected
   input format for timespan is not written. 
  
System.TimeSpan.AsString(System.String)
   The function to parse a string and convert to the expected
   input format for timespan is not written. 
   
System.TimeSpan.ReadAsString(System.TimeSpan)
   The function to parse a string and convert to the expected
   input format for timespan is not written. 
   
System.TimeSpan.WriteAsString(System.TimeSpan, System.String)
   The function to parse a string and convert to the expected
   input format for timespan is not written. 
   
System.LastIndexOf(System.String, System.String)
   No recursion available in an expression in order to find the last occurence of the substring within the string.

System.LastPos(System.String, System.String)
   No recursion available in an expression in order to find the last occurence of the substring within the string.
