The MSSQLDevice provided with Dataphor provides a device for 
communicating with Microsoft SQL Server, versions 7.0 and 
2000. The device is also capable of communicating with the 
Microsoft Desktop Engine (MSDE).

===============================================

EXAMPLE:

create device MSSQLTestDevice
	reconciliation { mode = { command }, master = device }
	class "MSSQLDevice"
	attributes
	{
		"ServerName" = ".",
		"UseIntegratedSecurity" = "True", // set to false or remove to use SQL Server Authentication
		"DatabaseName" = "Northwind"
	};

In this example:
 The name of the device is "MSSQLTestDevice".
 The reconciliation mode is "command".
 The reconciliation master is "device".
 The class is "MSSQLDevice".
 The data will be stored on the MS SQL server running on the local machine.
 Windows authentication will be used to authenticate the connection. 
 The name of the database on the MS SQL server will be Northwind.

If "UseIntegratedSecurity" is removed or set to false then it is necessary
to map MS SQL Server users to Dataphor users such as:
	
	CreateDeviceUser("System", "MSSQLTestDevice", "sa", "SomePassword");
	CreateDeviceUser("Admin", "MSSQLTestDevice", "sa", "SomePassword");

Dataphor Reference under Libraries, MSSQLDevice.
