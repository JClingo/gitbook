Operators not supported in the DB2 device:


LibraryReference Operators
   The LibraryReference selector/accessor operators and any operator that take an argument of type 
   LibraryReference are not supported by the DB2 device. This date type is not currently supported 
   for the DB2 device.

LibraryDescriptor Operators
   The LibraryDescriptor selector/accessor operators and any operator that take an argument of type 
   LibraryDescriptor are not supported by the DB2 device. This date type is not currently supported 
   for the DB2 device.

FileReference Operators
   The LibraryDescriptor selector/accessor operators and any operator that take an argument of type 
   LibraryDescriptor are not supported by the DB2 device. This date type is not currently supported 
   for the DB2 device.

System.IsUpper(System.String)
   DB2 provides no function to evaluate the case of a string. Also there is no way of iterating 
   through a string to evaluate each character within an expression.

System.IsLower(System.String)
   DB2 provides no function to evaluate the case of a string. Also there is no way of iterating 
   through a string to evaluate each character within an expression.

System.PadLeft(System.String, System.Integer)
   DB2 does not provide an equivalent function and there is no method for adding characters recursively
   until the length is equal to that specified by the second parameter within an expression. 

System.PadLeft(System.String, System.Integer, System.String)
   DB2 does not provide an equivalent function and there is no method for adding characters recursively
   until the length is equal to that specified by the second parameter within an expression. 

System.PadRight(System.String, System.Integer, System.String)
   DB2 does not provide an equivalent function and there is no method for adding characters recursively
   until the length is equal to that specified by the second parameter within an expression. 

System.Math.Factorial(System.Integer)
   Recursion which is necessary is not possible within an expression.

System.Math.Random(System.Integer)  

System.Math.Random(System.Integer, System.Integer)

System.Math.Seed()

System.Math.Seed(System.Integer)

System.All(System.Boolean)
   DB2 has no support for the Boolean data type.

System.Any(System.Boolean)
   DB2 has no support for the Boolean data type.

System.ToTimeSpan(System.String)
   The function to parse a string and convert to the expected
   input format for timespan is not written. 
  
System.TimeSpan.AsString(System.String)
   The function to parse a string and convert to the expected
   input format for timespan is not written. 
   
System.TimeSpan.ReadAsString(System.TimeSpan)
   The function to parse a string and convert to the expected
   input format for timespan is not written. 
   
System.TimeSpan.WriteAsString(System.TimeSpan, System.String)
   The function to parse a string and convert to the expected
   input format for timespan is not written. 
   
System.LastIndexOf(System.String, System.String)
   No recursion available in an expression in order to find the last occurence of the substring within the string.

System.LastPos(System.String, System.String)
   No recursion available in an expression in order to find the last occurence of the substring within the string.
